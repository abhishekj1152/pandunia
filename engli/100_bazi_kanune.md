### 1.3. The basic rules

These are the basic rules of Pandunia language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Words consist of a stem and one or more suffixes.
   The last suffix indicates the word class to which the word belongs.
    - Adjectives end in **-i**, ex. **novi** = new.
    - Adverbs end in **-o**, ex. **novo** = newly.
    - Active verbs end in **-a**, ex. **me loga** = I speak.
    - Passive verbs end in **-u**, ex. **le logu** = It is spoken.
    - Nouns end in **-e**, **-ia** or a consonant.
4. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
5. Adjectives come before the word that they modify.
   All adjectives, except the most common few, end in **-i**.
    - ex. **rapidi loge** = Fast speech.
6. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs and complete sentences.
   They come before the word that they modify or very last in the sentence.
   All adverbs, except the most common few, end in **-o**.
    - ex. 1. **vero rapidi loge** = Very fast speech.
    - ex. 2. **te loga bono.** = You talk well.
7. The verb ending **-u** indicates that
   the subject has or gets the thing that is denoted by the verb root.
    - ex. **maw yamu fixe.** = The cat eats fish.
    - ex. **buke kitabu.** = Books get written.
8. The verb ending **-a** indicates that
   the subject gives or causes the thing that is denoted by the verb root.
    - ex. **me yama maw.** = I feed the cat.
    - ex. **me kitaba buke.** = I write a books.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
   functions as the subject of the next verb.
    - ex. **me pliza te dona pes.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **me eska te baxa pandunia?** → **eska te baxa pandunia?** = Do
      you speak Pandunia?
    - **me pliza te loga mingo.** →  **pliza loga mingo.**
      = Please speak clearly.
11. Compound words are created by putting the word stems side by side.
    The linking vowel **-o-** is inserted between the stems.
    - ex. **hur-** (freedom) + **ist-** (proponent) → **huriste** (liberalist)
    - ex. **post-** (mail) + **sanduk-** (box) → **postosanduke** (mailbox)
