# Verbs

## Introduction

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.

In Pandunia, a verb can involve an agent, a recipient, and an object.
The agent performs or "causes" the action,
and the recipient receives or "experiences" the action.

Pandunia has two types of verb:
verbs that end in **-a** and verbs that end in **-u**.
The endings decide the role of the subject,
whether it is the causer or the recipient of the action.

With verbs that end in **-u**,
the subject has, gets or experiences the thing that is denoted by the verb root.
For example, **fob-** means _fear_, so **fobu** means "to have fear" or, simply, "to fear".
**yam-** means _food_, so **yamu** means "to get food" or, simply, "to eat".

| The baby       | is born.       |                |

With verbs that end in **-a**,
the subject gives or causes the thing that is denoted by the verb root.
For example, **fob-** means _fear_, so **foba** means "to give fear", "to cause fear" or, simply, "to frighten".

## Prepositions

In Pandunia, prepositions are basically a sub-category of verbs.

### Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **sa** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in,
   on, by, during, while
2. **na** - absence or lack: without
3. **ca** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **pa** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

**me sa hotel.**
– I'm in the hotel.  
**me sonu sa hotel.**
– I sleep in the hotel.  
**me sonu ca xame pa sube.**
– I sleep since evening until morning.  
**me safara ca london pa paris.**
– I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

**me denga ca te gowa.**
– I have waited since you left.  
**me denga pa te laya dome.**
– I wait until you come home.  
**me denga sa te sona.**
– I wait while you sleep.  

#### sa

**sa** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**me libu sa dome.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**me loga sa pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**me loga sa doste sa pandunia sa fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia by telephone.

#### Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

**me kata pang.** - I cut bread.  
**me kata pang, uza caku.** - I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

**me denga dura dul hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

**bada** - to follow; after, behind  
**dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
**jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
**loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
**sirka** - to surround; around  
**supra** - to surpass; over, above  

#### Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

**me laya dome.** - I come home.  
**te sida kurse.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
**le lala sofa'.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
**fix nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
**jenger marca daw.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

### Preposition of relation

Preposition **ko** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to
English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

**me jana pandunia ko gur.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**ko** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In
the above example **jana** (know) is the verb and **gur** (master) is
the point of comparison.

**ko** is also used when adjectives are compared.

**bace si min day ko pape.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
**law pape si samo day ko pape.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**ko** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min**
(less) and **samo** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is
**pape** (father) in the examples above.
